Hi,  
I'm Cédric JUNG and you are on my website.  


I'm living in France, and I'm really young as a programmer, 17 years old. I started to code just for fun in 2013.


I started to code with Visual Basic, it was pretty easy. When I was playing Minecraft, I did some Java to change the game. To share those changes I wanted to created a website therefore I used PHP. At first sight, PHP was pretty cool, but I quickly moved to JavaScript. I'm a fan of JavaScript and specifically of Node.js (server-side JavaScript). I discovered this one some years ago, I use it in the most of my applications.


I really love to share my passions that's why I published the most of my software to [GitHub](//cedced19.github.io) under the [MIT](/license) license (I've already created about 110 repositories).


I've created about ten Android applications. They are all published on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8053368172585015347).

Since 2018 I am part of the organization Découverto, which organizes cultural walks and creates books. With this organization, I created the application [Bestiaire Héraldique](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bestiaireheraldique) that allows you to have an audio guide on your phone.
