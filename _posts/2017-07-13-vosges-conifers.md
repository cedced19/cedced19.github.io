During the last year of secondary school in France, students must complete a **T**ravail **P**ersonnel **E**ncadr√© (TPE) in groups of 2 to 4 people. You have to choose a topic and find a problematic.

With two friends, I had to work on the following problematic that you can find in French above on the cover page of our file: *"Is the decline of the Vosges conifers still mainly linked to acid rain?"*

We were rewarded with a score of 18/20 for this baccalaureate exam.
