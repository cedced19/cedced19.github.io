The first months of the year were rather peaceful. In fact, I prepared the competitive exams for the Grandes Ecoles d'Ingénieurs which finally took place because of the epidemic at the end of June. 
I remember making a lot of progress in Maths and Physics in March-April at my home in Phalsbourg.

I will almost forget that I took part in the municipal election of my town Phalsbourg. Even if my list came second out of five, I still have good memories of it. This experience gave me a better understanding of how politics works. I've been using it ever since.

From May to August, as usual, I went back to the paths, by bike alone or accompanied, as well as on foot with beautiful anecdotes, discoveries and encounters.

I must also not forget the success of our application to deconfinement because of some articles in the DNA (*Dernières Nouvelles d’Alsace*) and the desire of nature because of the confinement.

The most exotic this year was the discovery of Luxembourg or a 3h horse ride at the end of August.

In July, I did two interviews during which I met Jacky from the “Club Vosgiens de Dabo”: [France 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJLlbs4fux0), [Mirabelle TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPa-TcsNXr0)
I also gave a hand to the “Club Vosgiens de Dabo” in August. 

On August 15th, I got the results of my exams, I was admitted to the Ecole Centrale de Lille. On this occasion, I want to thank those who supported me during these two years of preparation which presented a lot of work and investment.

On August 7th, I guided a hike with young children aged 10-12 years with animators from the “Réseau Animation Jeunesse du Pays de Saverne”. It was really nice and gives hope.

In September, I joined the Ecole Centrale de Lille. I saw beautiful things there, I met beautiful people during the two months I was there before being isolated again to my home in Phalsbourg. Among them are my godmother (in engineering schools an inter-promotion sponsorship system is often set up by the students) and her friends.

In October, after a visit at [Est FM](https://www.estfm.fr/podcasts/l-association-decouverto-sur-est-fm-1189) with Découverto, I met Théo from Pfalzweyer who showed us the old firing range, which is very little known. 

In November, I developed the [Découverto iOS application](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1538334399) in a week. An Apple bug simply prevented me from releasing it quickly. 

The last days of the year were again rich in encounters, new adventures are offered to me.

I wish you a happy new year 2021. I hope that I am not prevented from working again.
