Today, I did my first talk to an audience other than a classroom during a presentation. It was not easy, not because I was stressed, but because I did it in English, which is not my native language. Moreover the KarlsruheJS conference takes place as its name suggests in Karlsruhe, Germany, so I mixed some English and German words. I even said "two thousand and *elf*". 

I recommand you to go to the KarlsruheJS conferences. These people are adorable.

This talk was about *react-native*, and the slide are [there](https://cedced19.github.io/talk-react-native).
