In fact, I prepared the competitive exams for the Grandes Ecoles d'Ingénieurs which finally took place because of the epidemic at the end of June. I remember making a lot of progress in Maths and Physics in March-April at my home in Phalsbourg.</p><p>I will almost forget that I took part in the municipal election of my town Phalsbourg. Even if my list came second out of five, I still have good memories of it. This experience gave me a better understanding of how politics works. I've been using it ever since.</p><p>From May to August, as usual, I went back to the paths, by bike alone or accompanied, as well as on foot with beautiful anecdotes, discoveries and encounters.</p><p>I must also not forget the success of our application to deconfinement because of some articles in the DNA (<em>Dernières Nouvelles d’Alsace</em>) and the desire of nature because of the confinement.</p><p>The most exotic this year was the discovery of Luxembourg or a 3h horse ride at the end of August.</p><p>In July, I did two interviews during which I met Jacky from the “Club Vosgiens de Dabo”: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJLlbs4fux0">France 3</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPa-TcsNXr0">Mirabelle TV</a> I also gave a hand to the “Club Vosgiens de Dabo” in August.</p><p>On August 15th, I got the results of my exams, I was admitted to the Ecole Centrale de Lille. On this occasion, I want to thank those who supported me during these two years of preparation which presented a lot of work and investment.</p><p>On August 7th, I guided a hike with young children aged 10-12 years with animators from the “Réseau Animation Jeunesse du Pays de Saverne”. It was really nice and gives hope.</p><p>In September, I joined the Ecole Centrale de Lille. I saw beautiful things there, I met beautiful people during the two months I was there before being isolated again to my home in Phalsbourg. Among them are my godmother (in engineering schools an inter-promotion sponsorship system is often set up by the students) and her friends.</p><p>In October, after a visit at <a href="https://www.estfm.fr/podcasts/l-association-decouverto-sur-est-fm-1189">Est FM</a> with Découverto, I met Théo from Pfalzweyer who showed us the old firing range, which is very little known.</p><p>In November, I developed the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1538334399">Découverto iOS application</a> in a week. An Apple bug simply prevented me from releasing it quickly.</p><p>The last days of the year were again rich in encounters, new adventures are offered to me.</p><p>I wish you a happy new year 2021. I hope that I am not prevented from working again.</p></div> </article></div> </main><footer class="site-footer"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="footer-heading">Cédric JUNG</h2><div class="footer-col-wrapper"><div class="footer-col footer-col-1"><ul class="contact-list"><li> Cédric JUNG</li><li><a href="mailto:cedric@cedric-jung.eu">cedric@cedric-jung.eu</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-2"><ul class="social-media-list"><li> <a href="https://github.com/cedced19"><span class="icon icon--github"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16px" height="16px"><path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/></svg> </span><span class="username">cedced19</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-3"><p>I love creating new things, walking in the forest, running and cross-country cycling.</p></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
